            <h2>Introduction: The New Way to Connect</h2>
            <p>
              Video editing is not just about trimming clips or adding transitions — it's about storytelling through media that connects emotionally with viewers. In today's digital era, from YouTube to Netflix to Instagram Reels, the ability to weave a story using visuals, sound, and pacing defines the success of a video.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're an aspiring filmmaker, social media creator, or digital marketer, understanding how to tell a story through editing can elevate your content from simple footage to memorable art.
            </p>
            
            <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
              <h4>Programme Details</h4>
              <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 Months<br />
              <strong>Mode:</strong> 100% Work from Home<br />
              <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Open to students, recent graduates, and young professionals passionate about learning and gaining work experience.<br />
              <strong>Certificate:</strong> Provided upon successful completion</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What does Video Editing entail</h2>
            <p>
              Video editing is not just about trimming clips—it's the art of transforming raw footage into powerful stories that evoke emotion and deliver impact. For aspiring creators, video editing internships provide the perfect platform to explore this creative process, gain real-world experience, and understand the dynamics of professional production.
            </p>
            <p>
              In today's digital-first world, videos dominate marketing, entertainment, and education. Whether you're crafting short-form social media content or cinematic storytelling for brands, mastering editing tools and techniques during your internship can set the tone for a rewarding career.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Video Editing Internships Matter</h2>
            <p>
              Video editing internships are the first step toward becoming a professional storyteller. They allow learners to work with real clients, understand timelines, and practice creative decision-making under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>Here's why they're essential for beginners:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>Practical exposure to professional editing environments.</li>
              <li>Direct mentorship from experienced editors or filmmakers.</li>
              <li>Opportunity to learn industry-standard software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve.</li>

              <li>Networking with professionals in media, marketing, and entertainment industries.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Finding the ideal video editing internship opportunity requires strategy and research. Instead of applying randomly, focus on aligning your interests with the right kind of organization.
            </p>
            <p>Here's how to do it effectively:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
